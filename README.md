# üë®‚Äçüíª Kerem T√ºrk√∂z√º ‚Äî MSc. Software Engineer

---

## Summary

While pursuing my **Master‚Äôs in Software Engineering**, I develop versatile software solutions across **mobile, web, and embedded systems**.  
Through my multidisciplinary experience, I focus on building projects that prioritize **reliability, performance, and sustainability**.  

I have **2 years of hands-on experience in iOS development** (Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit) and contributed to a **defense industry stock tracking system** using **.NET Core, Angular, and MSSQL**. Additionally, I have experience in **Python** for data processing, machine learning, automation, and algorithm design.  

Proficient in **modern software development practices** (Clean Architecture, MVVM, CI/CD, Agile/Scrum), I can quickly adapt to different technology stacks. With **15+ published iOS applications on the App Store** and **100+ technical articles on Medium**, I continue to contribute actively to the software ecosystem.  

As a **motivated, adaptive, and open-to-learning developer**, my goal is to bring value to critical projects while keeping up with emerging technologies.
